A. Always yields 1
	Because converting int to double will keep the original value.



B. Sometimes yields 0
	Because somtimes x - y will overflow, but not dx - dy. Double has
a far more greater range.



C. Sometimes yields 0
	Because floating-point addition is not associative.



D. Sometimes yields 0
	Because floating-point multiplication is not associative.



A. Always yields 1
	Because floating-point division is simply applying rounding to the exact
result of real operations, and dx / dx = dz / dz = 1.

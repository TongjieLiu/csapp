						Extended Precision
Description				Value				Decimal
Smallest positive denormalized   0.0...01 * 2^{1 - (2^{15 - 1} - 1)}    0.0...01
                               = 2^{-63} * 2^{2 - 2^14}          (at least 5000 zeros)
                               = 2^{- 2^14 - 61}
Smallest positive normalized     1.0 * 2^{1 - (2^{15 -1} - 1)}          0.0...01
                               = 2^{2 - 2^14}                    (at least 5000 zeros)

Largest normalized          1.1...1 * 2^{(2^15 - 2) - (2^{15 - 1} - 1)}  1000...000
           approximately, = 2 * 2^{2^14 - 1}                     (at least 5000 zeros)
                          = 2^{2^14}

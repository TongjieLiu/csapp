A.   A series of complex numbers are stored into a series of XMM registers when
they are passed as arguments.
     Moreover, a complex number is represented by two floating-point numbers,
the real part and the imaginary part of it, which are stored separately into
two XMM registers with the real part in lower-rank register and the imaginary
part in higher-rank register. For example, %xmm0 = <real part of the first
complex argument>, %xmm1 = <imaginary part of the first complex argument>.



B. If the return value of a function is a complex number, %xmm0 stores the
real part of it, and %xmm1 stores the imaginary part of it.

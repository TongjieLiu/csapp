	To measure the performance of three version of bubble sort assembly
language program, we only have to run the following commands:
	$ tar xf sim.tar
	$ cd sim

	# comment out all 3 variables for GUI in the Makefile. #
	$ make clean
	$ make

	$ cd pipe
	# comment out all 3 variables for GUI in the Makefile. #
	$ make clean
	$ make psim # PIPE from the book

	$ cd ../y86-code
	# copy Homework_4.47b.ys, Homework_4.48.ys, and Homework_4.49.ys here #
	$ make clean
	$ make Homework_4.47b.yo
	$ make Homework_4.48.yo
	$ make Homework_4.49.yo

	$ ../pipe/psim -v0 Homework_4.47b.yo
	CPI: 1406 cycles/1059 instructions = 1.33

	$ ../pipe/psim -v0 Homework_4.48.yo
	CPI: 2111 cycles/1734 instructions = 1.22

	$ ../pipe/psim -v0 Homework_4.49.yo
	CPI: 1706 cycles/1419 instructions = 1.20

	Clearly, 4.49 > 4.48 > 4.47 in terms of performance.

	First of all, conditional transfer of control is much slower than condi-
tional transfer of data, since the former is implemented in pipeline processors
with many bubbles due to mispredicted branch.

	Secondly, the difference between 4.49 and 4.48 in performance is more
about the specific algorithms, since both of them use conditional transfer of
data method.
